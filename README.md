# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions based on anonymized data. It implements data preprocessing, SMOTE (oversampling), LightGBM with Optuna hyperparameter tuning, threshold optimization (TPR - FPR), SHAP explainability, and a user-friendly Streamlit interface.
